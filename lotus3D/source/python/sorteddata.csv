Unsure about how much it will help people in the long run,4
"Think it's helpful n easy to use, accessible n lots of ways to use",1
There will be pros and cons with it. It will definitely make certain things easier.,3
The first time I was on a phone call Me back to the grocery store and,5
So I don't know it's kind of scary. It is not real and I don't understand how it works like cryptocurrency.,2
Scary thought but it helps us alot im just scared they can take over humans,3
Powerful but scary but can change the world for the positive because it is so innovative and can help people accomplish so much it is very important and powerful,3
Positive feelings in general. That's my overall feelings,1
Positive and hope that it becomes more universal.,1
Nothing strong either way but it might be the end of humanity,3
Nothing really don't know much about it need to learn more about it I guess it's the new thing,4
Not sure I have mixed feelings about it it's good and bad,3
Not good it's not how people should learn it makes people lazy and not work hard,2
"No strong feelings at this present time, in a wait and see mode.",4
No real comments this sure has been a lot of hype about it I'm not quite sure if it's going to be a good or bad in regards to Medicine I think it will be helpful,3
Love it. It's going to make life so much easier,1
Like it a lot and will use it for sakes now and in the future,1
Leaning towards not good. Feel like it's gonna be bad.,2
Just getting used to the benefits.  Hope it causes more good than harm,3
Its a good creation for the world to see and hear from you and your family and friends and cdr,5
It's very very helpful yet at the same time very scary.,3
It's useful when used correctly. Sometimes It's better to do it manually without the help of smart features.,3
It's useful and entertaining I think. It's fun to use them.,1
It's us ok do not know much about it but heard of it,4
It's the future industry to rule all industries for mankind.,1
"It's scary as hell, it's too realistic and too smart",2
It's really cool. I loooooooooooooooooove it.,1

It's going to be very useful and helpful and completely change the computer industry,1
It's amazing you can do so many things while it being useful and responsive,1

It's a new wave of technology that's going to change the future,1
It's a great tools to use and it's very helpful to figure things out.,1
It'll help the human race a lot better. It allows from work personalized advertisement and customizations of our ads that we see in our day-to-day lives,1
It terrifys me if I'm going to be truthful.  I think it will be the death of the human race.,2
It sucks and it is frightening because it will be abused,2
It stands for artificial intelligence and technology,5
It should only be used as a tool and for the more monotonous draining jobs,3
It should be monitored but can be useful. AI can help people in many ways but could be dangerous if not properly handled.,3
It seems very interesting and I might be interested,4
It seems cool to have a bit of help of someone who isn't real yet they know a lot since it's a robot,1

In the middle. Kind of concerned because of how life like it is,3
"I'm very open to AI, I think it will be interesting to watch how it matures over time",1
