Thoughts on all_links chart -- a cool visualization but with limited utility:

	This chart uses different color conventions than all of the other charts and isn't really all that useful as a metric; it should be redone to have four color categories, rather than switching from red to green when the market changes -- the current convention. Also, this chart will be a lot more meaningful with securities ranked by market cap rather than volume (as in the crypto charts). Why? In that schema, symbol positions stay put over a trading day. With the chart ranking mapped to volume, symbols can shift quite a bit in a single day.

	For now it should be considered deprecated.

working_views contain Legacy column names. They are there to show the Lotus Chart in action with various amounts of data on the chart.
